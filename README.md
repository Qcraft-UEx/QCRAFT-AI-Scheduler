# QCRAFT-AI-Scheduler
QCRAFT AI Scheduler: a tool that optimizes the execution of multiple quantum tasks by combining them into efficient batches. Designed for cloud-based quantum computing platforms (e.g., IBM Q, AWS Braket), it leverages AI-based decision-making to reduce execution costs and waiting times without sacrificing result fidelity, using a Deep Learning model.
